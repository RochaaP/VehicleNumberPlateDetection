## OpenCV-Python

OpenCV-Python is a library of Python bindings designed to solve computer vision problems

OpenCV-Python makes use of Numpy, which is a highly optimized library for numerical operations with a MATLAB-style syntax. All the OpenCV array structures are converted to and from Numpy arrays. This also makes it easier to integrate with other libraries that use Numpy such as SciPy and Matplotlib

### Installations 

 In commard line run these command lines for some installtions
 
        pip install numpy
        
        pip install matplotlib
        
        pip install opencv-python
        
        pip install requests
        
        
 
 
 Then run python in commandline
      
        C:/python27/python
        
               import cv2
               import matplotlib
               import numpy
               import requests
         
Then ready to roll.
